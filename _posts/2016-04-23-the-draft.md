Every year, teams pour over files, film and first-hand accounts of young men they are about to give millions (or in some cases many thousands) of dollars to.   
This process is a ritualistic cleansing for most fans, a metamorphosis, if you will. The time of year to finally turn the page on last year's failures with eyes set to the horizon, welcoming what youth and vigor will bring.

But can running really fast in shorts really make you a better foozeball player? I dunno, I'm a fat old man who's idea of running fast is when I see an opening in the buffet line. 

Suffice it to say, these youngin's are getting one helluva good opportunity at making some real cashola, so if it's stripping down to your skivvies and lifting some weights infront of a bunch of guys who want to see your shirt off anyways, then thats America, folks.
