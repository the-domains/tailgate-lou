Foozeball.

America's greatest past-time is on overtime, and the media machine is trying to spin it every which way but loose for ya. I'm here as an old-timer to give you some cold, hard truth-facts about how I see the American Football fiasco as it stands today... and maybe an occaisional recipe or two, just because us old fat guys like to know how to stay that way.

Now keep in mind that this here thing is what I've been told is a "blog", so the thoughts and opinions here are definitely my own special brand of salty. And while I might not say anything that hasn't been somehow said before, even a re-freshed perspective can be nice.  
  
So grab a seat, crack a cold one and try the wing dip, 'cause here it comes... straight from the grill!
